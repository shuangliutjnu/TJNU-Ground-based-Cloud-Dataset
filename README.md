# TJNU-Ground-based-Cloud-Dataset

The TJNU ground-based cloud dataset (GCD) is collected from 2019 to 2020 in nine provinces of China, which includes Tianjin, Anhui, Sichuan, Gansu, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Hainan. It contains 19,000 ground-based cloud images. According to the International cloud classification system criteria published in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as well as the visual similarity of cloud in practice, the sky conditions are divided into seven sky types: 1) cumulus, 2) altocumulus and cirrocumulus, 3) cirrus and cirrostratus, 4) clear sky, 5) stratocumulus, stratus and altostratus, 6) cumulonimbus and nimbostratus, 7) mixed cloud. Besides, cloud images with cloudiness no more than 10% are categorized into the clear sky. The cloud images are captured by camera sensors and stored in JPEG format with the pixel resolution of 512×512. GCD is divided into 10,000 training cloud images and 9,000 test cloud images. All the cloud images are cooperatively annotated by the meteorologists and the ground-based cloud researchers. The GCD will be provided free of charge to cloud-related researchers in order to promote research. Hereunder, some ground-based cloud images from each class are presented.
